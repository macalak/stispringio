Let's have a look at Spring Bean life-cycle features. 
This Lab will help you to understand the basic concept.
Bean life-cycle management will be demonstrated on ite.librarymaster.dao.JdbcBookRepository class.
We need Spring container to initialize and properly destroy our bean, i.e. the initialize() method
should be calls after bean instantiation and cleanup() method should be called after application
context destruction. You will also learn, how Spring is able to manipulate Beam definition and
Bean itself using Spring container extension points. 



1. Run the JdbcBookRepositoryTest JUnit test. Test should run just fine.
   Check console output and notice that neither JdbcBookRepository Bena's initialize()
   method not cleanup() method was called by container during test execution.
   Let's fix this.
   
 
2. We need to instruct Spring container to call callback methods either during Bean initialization or
   Bean destruction. Open ite.librarymaster.dao.JdbcBookRepository class source code and notice
   there are two life-cycle callback methods defined (there is no concrete  implementation, but log message is logged):
   initialize(){...}
   cleanup(){...}
   
   Annotate initialize() method  by @PostConstruct annotation and cleanup() method by @PreDestroy annotation.
   Re-run the JdbcBookRepositoryTest test and check output console for appropriate log messages.
 
3. It is good practice to externalize configuration variables into separate .properties files and use placeholders
   instead real values in container configuration xml file. Spring comes with usefull PropertyPlacehoderConfigurer
   BeanFactoryPostProcessor which replaces bean property placeholders with values from .properties file. Remember
   that BeanFactoryPostProcessor is able to change Beans DEFINITION.
    
   There is dataSource bean defined in src/test/resources/ite/librarymaster/dao/JdbcBookRepositoryTest-context.xml.
   There are two classpath sql file locations defined for this embedded data source. Let's externalize these values
   into testdb.properties file and use ${placeholder}s instead concrete property values.
   
   Create Java property filesrc/test/resources/ite/librarymaster/testdb/testdb.properties with following content:
                
   schemaLocation=classpath:ite/librarymaster/testdb/schema.sql
   testDataLocation=classpath:ite/librarymaster/testdb/test-data.sql

   Then replace concrete values with placeholder in dataSource Bean configuration.

   	<jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource">
		<jdbc:script location="${schemaLocation}"/>
		<jdbc:script location="${testDataLocation}"/>
	</jdbc:embedded-database>
	
	Now we need to tell Spring container to use PropertyPlacehoderConfigurer BeanFactoryPostProcessor.
	We can do it by adding <context:property-placeholder/> element into JdbcBookRepositoryTest-context.xmlfile.
	
	<context:property-placeholder location="classpath:ite/librarymaster/testdb/testdb.properties"/>
   	
   	Try to execute JdbcBookRepositoryTest and see if it works.
   	
4. What about BeanPostProcessor ? The BeanPostProcessor can be used to apply behaviors to objects created by 
   Spring container. Spring framework provides some useful implementations for you. You can also implements your owns.
   What if we need to check if all Bean dependencies were set properly by container, before we use that Bean ?
   Such check can be implemented by BeanPostProcessor. Luckily, Spring implements this by @Required annotation.
   @Required annotation used with setter method assures that container checks, if dependency is not null before
   our Bean uses it. Spring container uses RequiresannotationBeanPostProcessor as concrete implementation of 
   the BeanPostProcessor.
   
   Try to comment out dataSource property definition for JdbcBookRepository Bean on JdbcBookRepositoryTest-context.xml.
   <!-- <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/> -->
   Run the JdbcBookRepositoryTest and see what happens. The problem is that such errors can be found only during application
   execution(when dataSource dependency is used for first time). It would be better to find such configuration error during 
   application initialization itself.
    
   Now, annotate the public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {...} method by @Required annotation and rerun the test 
   again. There is error again, but see what kind of error is returned this time.
   
   Finally, uncomment the dataSource property definition in JdbcBookRepositoryTest-context.xml.
   <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/> 
   
   The application should now works as expected.
   	   	
5. You have learned how to use container life-cycle callbacks and usefull predefined BeanFactoryPostProcessor and BeanPostProcessor.
   Now you can write and try your own PostProcessors.
